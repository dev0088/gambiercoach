Hello <%= @user.login_id %>,

Congratulations! You have been selected as a Student Conductor for the following trip:

<%= @bus.departure.strftime("%A, %B %d") %> departing <%= @bus.starting_point %> for <%= @bus.ending_point %> at <%= @bus.departure.strftime("%I:%M %p") %>

In the event of any complications (either in fulfilling your responsibility or regarding the departure) you may contact Rachel Hudson at (419) 494-6613.

--Student Conductor Responsibilities--

You agree to be bound by the Honor Code to uphold these duties to the best of your ability:

* 9pm the night before your trip, you will receive by e-mail the passenger list for your bus. You will print this out and bring it with you.
* You will arrive at least 25 minutes early to the bus.
* As students begin boarding, you will ask them for their UNIX ID, and check it off on the list.
* If a student does not have a ticket, they must wait until everyone else has boarded, and then if there are seats left they can purchase a ticket by giving you their name, Williams ID# (Ex: W1234567), school e-mail address, cell phone, and home phone.
* You will make sure that the bus departs ON TIME, even if not everyone on the list has shown up, if the trip is going TO an airport. If it is a return trip to the College, it is your discretion to give a little leeway.
* You will work with the driver to make sure that the trip goes safely and smoothly.   

* After your trip, you will automatically receive an email with a link. Follow the link to input the information you collected (people who rode, people who purchased tickets at the door). Once you do this, your ticket will be refunded! 


Thanks,
